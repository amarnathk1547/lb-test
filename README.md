LB test

Easy and simple setup to get this working.

1. Get node installed (Developed on v18.15.0)
2. Get npm installed (Developed on 9.5.0)
3. Get Cypress installed (Developed on v12.12.0)
4. Get chrome installed (Developed on 113.0.5672.126 official build)

Should be worked on other versions too, since there are no version specific requirements unless using obsolete or much older versions

1. Since it is a node project, use npm or yarn to install dependencies -> `npm i`
2. Run tests by opening cypressing independently and witness the execution if you wish to using `npx cypress open`
3. Run all tests quickly using `npx cypress run` (Caution: Before doing this see the execution videos which are already available)

PS: The UI test didn't work when using Cypress, not sure if this is because I'm in a different location. I have just scripted it but didn't do a dry run because of the stated problem. Execution video explains the problem.
